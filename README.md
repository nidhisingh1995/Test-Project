1.The .md file extension is less familiar, but these files are actually just simple text files. You don’t need any fancy software to open them. Keep reading to learn how to easily open a .md file and what this file type is used for.
2.A .md file is a plain-text document that contains no other elements. The text can be formatted usingspecial inline text symbols. For example, if you want a word or paragraph to be displayed in bold, you need to type two asterisks before and after it. The “MD” in the .md file extension (also written as .markdown) stands for “Markdown documentation”. 
3.Developers and technophiles also use Markdown. For programmers, .md files are a convenient way of archiving and comparing different versions of source code because it’s easier to compare content and identify changes in a markup language compared to in a binary format. It’s also easier to convert the files to HTML.
